If you’ve been following my work, you know I’m obsessed with pushing AI tools past the point of basic generation into true hyper-realistic, cinematic visual design. Good output isn't magic; it’s engineering. It comes down to using the right ingredients.

I call my personal prompt formula the "Nano Banana" style—it’s punchy, precise, and delivers results that look like they belong in a high-budget editorial shoot.

I recently dropped a challenge on Instagram: Steal My Prompts. Why keep the secrets locked away? Here is a deep dive into the exact prompts I use to generate these styles, covering everything from high fashion editorials to moody urban cinematography.

## 1. Defining Editorial Fashion & Vibe

The key to hyper-realistic fashion content is being specific about the pose, the apparel volume, and the background color (including hex codes if necessary). This ensures the AI understands the exact mood you’re aiming for—not just a person in clothes, but a stylized fashion moment.

<prompt>Hyper-realistic urban fashion portrait of a young man sitting in a stylized pose, with a low angle emphasizing his sneakers. He wears an oversized light-toned athletic outfit, featuring a hoodie and a voluminous plush jacket. The sneakers have a modern design, white with vibrant purple details, creating a striking contrast against a vivid Butter Yellow (#F6D860) background. The setting is minimalist, with a solid yellow backdrop that highlights the figures.</prompt>

## 2. Cinematic Scenes and Environmental Storytelling

To generate truly immersive images, you need to treat the prompt like a movie script. Specify the setting, the weather, the atmosphere, and crucial camera details like bokeh and depth of field. This is how you move from a snapshot to a visual narrative.

We start with high-contrast luxury in a freezing environment. Notice the attention paid to subtle elements like "cold breath subtly visible in the air" and the "creamy bokeh."

<prompt>Full-body shot of a man leaning confidently against the hood of a blue Lamborghini Urus in an outdoor snowy winter setting. He is wearing a stylish winter jacket layered over a shirt, fitted trousers, polished shoes, and a leather strap watch, with a tattoo visible on his forearm. Cold breath subtly visible in the air. Snow blankets the ground and light frost touches the car surface, with cinematic reflections adding depth. Lighting is soft, natural winter daylight with dramatic contrast, shallow depth of field, creamy bokeh, hyper-realistic 8K detail, exuding billionaire winter vibe.</prompt>

### Urban Heights and Misty Pathways

For urban scenes, the magic is in the lights. Explicitly call out "bokeh lights" and "atmospheric haze" to give the image the depth and moody complexity of a real city night shot.

<prompt>Ultra-realistic cinematic portrait of a man sitting on the edge of a rooftop at night, overlooking a glowing blurred cityscape filled with bokeh lights. Subject is wearing a black cap, dark sunglasses, a blue denim jacket, black pants, and sneakers. Pose is casual, with arms resting naturally and body turned slightly to the side, gazing over the city. The background captures the height and depth of the city skyline with soft atmospheric haze. Lighting is cool-toned with ambient city glow, emphasizing edges of the subject. Framing is medium-full body in 3:4 aspect, high detail, 8K realism, moody urban vibe.</prompt>

And finally, how to capture a truly atmospheric, moody outdoor portrait that feels like a still from a dark fantasy film: focus on texture and light reflection (the wet ground).

Keep the misty forest pathway in the background with a dreamy, moody atmosphere.</prompt>

## 3. Stylistic Deep Dive: Controlling Texture, Focus, and Light

The most potent tool in advanced prompting is incorporating photography terminology. This tells the AI *how* the image should be captured, not just what's in it.

### Motion Blur and Emotional Intensity

If you want dynamic, conceptual art, you need to introduce variables that traditional photography uses, like shutter speed.

![Dramatic black and white portrait of a man with his head tilted back, surrounded by bookshelves, showing motion blur](https://pub-141831e61e69445289222976a15b6fb3.r2.dev/insta_post/DPWVDCXjGB4/image_9.webp)

<prompt>Convert this image into a Fine black and white photography of a handsome young man (take reference face as uploaded image face)with dark, his head tilted back in a moment of intense creative thought or ecstasy. He is wearing an open, loose white collared shirt, standing in a dimly lit study filled with stacks of books and papers. The image is captured with a slow shutter speed, creating dramatic horizontal motion blur that streaks the background and the edges of his form.</prompt>

### Isolating with Low Light

For introspection and drama, isolate the subject completely using a spotlight against absolute darkness.

<prompt>Cinematic low-light portrait of a young man in a black puffer jacket over a grey hoodie, standing motionless under a soft amber spotlight. The glow grazes his glasses and hair while the surrounding darkness swallows the rest, creating a mood of quiet introspection.</prompt>

### Vintage Film Aesthetics

To achieve a nostalgic or edgy street-wear editorial look, pile on textural elements: fisheye lens, vintage flash, grain, film scratches, and specific lighting temperatures (like "122K warm ambient lighting").
