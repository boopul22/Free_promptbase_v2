### Choosing Your Core Subject
Start with a clear subject. Instead of saying "a man playing pool," be specific about his clothing, his expression, and his posture.

### Adding Stylistic Modifiers
Lighting and depth are what make an image pop. Use terms like "soft bokeh," "volumetric lighting," or "cinematic texture." 

![Image](https://pub-141831e61e69445289222976a15b6fb3.r2.dev/insta_post/DRm6G-qjQaW/image_3.webp)
<prompt>A hyper-realistic, cinematic portrait of a man playing pool, captured mid-action as he leans forward to take a precise shot. The man is wearing a clean white fitted t-shirt that emphasizes his athletic arms, and a dark wristwatch on his left wrist. He grips the cue stick firmly, aligning it with the white cue ball positioned at the center of the frame. The composition places the viewer directly in front of the pool table, at ball level, creating a dramatic, first-person perspective. The man's intense focus is directed straight toward the cue ball, with a look of deep concentration. The foreground features a slightly blurred red ball to the left, adding cinematic depth and framing the scene naturally. The pool table's green felt surface appears textured and realistic, with smooth shadows cast by the overhead lighting. The cue stick has visible wood grain and a clean white tip. The background is slightly dark and softly blurred, allowing the subject and table to dominate the visual space. Lighting & Mood: Focused overhead light creates a strong, realistic highlight on the cue ball and subtle gradients across the player's face and shirt. Shadows are soft but directional, emphasizing the tension and precision of the moment. The tone should feel both realistic and slightly stylized, as though from a sports magazine cover or cinematic freeze-frame. Camera Specifications: Camera Angle: Low-angle shot at table height, directly facing the player (eye-to-ball perspective). Lens Type: 85mm lens for cinematic compression and sharp focus on the subject's upper body and the cue ball. Aperture: f/2.0 for shallow depth of field - sharp focus on the player's face and cue ball, with blurred background and foreground. Lighting: Overhead key light with soft diffusion; additional low ambient fill from the sides. Focus: On the face, cue stick, and white bail - rea bail in foreground blurred. Aspect Ratio: 4:5 Resolution: Ultra-realistic, 8K, cinematic texture and sharp contrast. Replace the current face with my uploaded face image, ensuring correct facial alignment, lighting consistency, and realistic blending with skin tone and shadow direction. Maintain all original proportions and body positioning for authenticity.</prompt>

### Incorporating Expert Techniques
Study the work shared by @webx.designer. Notice the use of low angles and wide-angle lenses to create an immersive feeling.

<prompt>Create a high-resolution, wide-angle portrait of a man (use the uploaded picture as reference for the face) squatting on an outdoor basketball court during sunset. The man is positioned at the center of the image, leaning slightly forward with his hands clasped together between his knees, looking directly into the camera with an intense, confident expression. He is wearing a black Nike t-shirt, gray shorts, and white sneakers. The background shows a beautifully colored sky transitioning from warm pink and orange tones near the horizon to cooler purples and blues above. Surrounding the court are blooming bushes with pink flowers, green grass, and distant trees, all softly illuminated by the sunset light. The camera perspective should be low and close to the ground, using a fisheye or ultra-wide lens effect that curves the court lines around the subject, adding a dynamic and immersive look. The overall mood should feel modern, energetic, and cinematic, blending street culture with natural beauty.</prompt>
