## How to use Part 19 prompts

### 4.1 Define goals and constraints

Before you write a prompt, set clear objectives and limits. Example: “Create three Instagram concept visuals for a eco-friendly brand, with a cool-blue color palette, minimal typography, and captions under 10 words.” Constraints keep results aligned with your campaign and save revision time.

### 4.2 Craft clear prompts

Be specific about the outcome you want. Include audience, tone, and deliverables. For instance: “Generate a mood board and a caption for a 15-second reel about sustainable fashion, using bold sans-serif typography and a monochrome palette with a single accent color.” Clarity reduces back-and-forth.

### 4.3 Iterate with feedback

Treat prompts as living briefs. Start with a draft, review, then refine. If a visual feels off, say “make it warmer,” “increase contrast,” or “shift to a retro vibe.” Small tweaks often unlock big improvements and faster approvals.

## Categories of prompts

### 5.1 Visual concept prompts — 40 words

Prompts that propose a core idea, mood, and composition for visuals. Example: “Create a hero image concept for a tech conference that feels futuristic, with clean lines, cool tones, and a subtle grid pattern.”

### 5.2 Caption and copy prompts — 40 words

Prompts that generate short, punchy captions and supporting lines. Example: “Write five Instagram captions under 10 words each, emphasizing sustainability and innovation, with a friendly tone.”

### 5.3 Mood and color prompts — 40 words

Prompts to set color stories and emotional tone. Example: “Suggest a color palette for a wellness brand: calm greens, soft neutrals, and a touch of sunrise peach.” 

### 5.4 Layout and typography prompts — 40 words

Prompts focused on grids, type pairing, and visual hierarchy. Example: “Propose a page layout with bold display type for headlines and ample white space, suitable for a 1080x1080 Instagram post.”

Prompts that align visuals with brand rules. Example: “Generate logo-friendly shapes and a logo lockup for a modern tech startup, with geometric forms and a single accent color.”

## Prompt formats and templates

### 6.1 Short prompts — 60 words

Short prompts are quick to run and great for rapid sprints. Example: “Create a 3-panel Instagram carousel about time management, using a soft blue palette and clean sans-serif typography. Include one bold headline per panel.” You can run many such prompts in a single session to compare options fast.

### 6.2 Multi-step prompts — 60 words

Multi-step prompts guide the AI through stages: mood, layout, draft copy, and final edits. Example: “Step 1: propose 3 mood boards for a coffee brand. Step 2: pick one mood and draft three post captions. Step 3: generate a 4-week content calendar.” This structure keeps projects organized.

### 6.3 Prompt templates for briefs — 60 words

Templates give you a repeatable starting point. Example: “Brief: Design a social series for a summer launch. Deliverables: 3 visuals, 5 captions, and a one-page brand brief. Constraints: 1080x1080 squares, warm palette, and accessible font sizes.” Save as a repeatable template for clients.

Use prompts to brainstorm visual ideas and captions that fit Instagram aesthetics. Example: “Generate 5 concept visuals for an eco-brand’s Instagram feed, each with a consistent color system, plus 5 caption options under 12 words that encourage action and sharing.”

### 7.2 YouTube Shorts and Reels prompts — 60 words

Short-form prompts should be punchy and visual. Example: “Draft 3 ideas for a 15-second Reel about design tips, with on-screen text, quick cuts, and a CTA to download a free asset pack.”

### 7.3 Pinterest and design boards prompts — 60 words

Pinterest prompts help build mood boards and pin-worthy visuals. Example: “Create 4 pin concepts focusing on minimal typography and organic shapes, with a pastel background and a single product shot per pin.”
