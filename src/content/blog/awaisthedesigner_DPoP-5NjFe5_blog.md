If you’ve spent any time generating AI imagery of yourself, you know the struggle: the style is perfect, the lighting is flawless, but the face? The face just doesn't match.

We all want hyper-realistic, high-fashion portraits that actually look like us. I’ve been experimenting heavily with advanced models like Gemini (Nano Banana) to crack the code on consistent face preservation.

The secret? Extremely detailed, intentional prompting that leaves nothing to chance—from the texture of the fabric to the focal length of the virtual camera. I'm sharing the exact prompts that delivered these jaw-dropping results.

## The Art of Low-Key Intensity

When creating dramatic, highly stylized portraits, you must specify the mood and the light. It's not enough to say "dark background." You need directional light, specific attire, and defined posture to convey a powerful presence.

For instance, a tight shot with elbows resting on the knees creates instant intensity. Notice how every detail—from the rolled sleeves to the visibility of the tattoos—is locked in the prompt below, ensuring the model focuses on contour and drama.

<prompt>Portrait of me sitting on a chair, leaning slightly forward with elbows resting on my knees, fingers interloked in front of my mouth in a thoughtful, intense pose. My gaze is directed straight into the camera, creating a strong, focused presence. I'm wearing a tight white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows, showing both of my fully tattooed forearms. Dark, fitted trousers complete the outfit. The lighting is dramatic and low key, with a deep black background that emphasizes the contours of my body and highlights my muscular arms and confident posture. The overall mood is serious, introspective, and powerful. same face.</prompt>

When aiming for a dynamic, fashion editorial look, focusing on the pose and the contrast between the clothing elements is essential. Adding specifics like "cinematic low-key lighting" and "soft spotlight on torso" ensures the result looks expensive, not flat.

<prompt>Stylish Portrait of me me putting on a black jacket over a tight white t-shirt that emphasizes a well-defined chest and arms, standing in a dynamic pose with one arm behind his back, wearing dark pants, modern masculine build, cinematic low-key lighting with dramatic shadows and cool tones, soft spotlight on torso, smooth gradient background with moody ambiance, fashion editorial style, studio photography, high contrast and shallow depth of field. aspect ratio ar 4:5. same face</prompt>

Another great way to build high-contrast drama is by defining the clothing texture, like this thick turtleneck, and then describing exactly where the light beam should fall—a technique common in professional photography.

<prompt>I am standing in a three-quarter pose, my body slightly turned to the left while my head faces forward, looking directly at the camera with a confident, intense gaze. My lips are pressed together, and my jawline is sharp under the light. My right shoulder is closer to the camera, and my arms remain relaxed at my sides, not visible in detail. I am wearing a thick, dark knitted sweater with a tall, turned-up turtleneck collar that frames my face, the fabric textured with chunky ribbing, giving a masculine and stylish appearance. The overall look is minimalist, without accessories except for a subtle metallic chain peeking from under the sweater. The scene is dramatically lit with a strong beam of warm light cutting diagonally across my face and upper body, creating high contrast between illuminated areas and deep shadows. The background is dark, matte, and softly textured, with a reddish tone that enhances the cinematic atmosphere. The camera angle is eye-level, capturing me from the chest up in a portrait style. The focal length is approximately 85mm, giving a natural compression to the face and emphasizing depth without distortion. The image feels cinematic, moody, and powerful, highlighting my facial features and the texture of the clothing with precision. same face.</prompt>

## Environment, Texture, and High-Fashion

Moving beyond the studio, the prompts must clearly articulate the environment and the specific elements (like bokeh) that make the scene feel authentic. The urban streetwear look works perfectly when paired with that soft, blurred city background.

<prompt>A cinematic portrait of me at night in an urban environment, standing casually with a slight lean backward, hands resting in my pockets. My shoulders are loose, exuding a confident yet laid-back attitude. I'm dressed in a sleek black bomber jacket layered over a clean white t-shirt, paired with dark joggers featuring visible drawstrings. My head is gently tilted upward and slightly to the left, while my gaze is locked directly on the camera. Behind me, a blur of city lights in warm red, orange, and white hues forms a vibrant bokeh, enhancing the depth of the scene. The atmosphere is warm and moody, with ambient reflections from nearby streetlights adding soft highlights to the jacket. The overall aesthetic reflects a modern, urban streetwear vibe. same face</prompt>

### Stylistic Constraints

For classic, powerful portraits, the monochromatic look is undefeated. By defining the posture as "relaxed yet dominant" and ensuring the suit is "wall-fitted all-black," you eliminate stylistic inconsistencies and focus the output entirely on mood.

When diving into high-end fashion, the key is naming the brand (even if generic, it signals high quality) and focusing on the scene aesthetics. Using terms like "hyper realistic scene" and "minimal clothing" ensures the focus stays on facial detail and atmospheric lighting.

<prompt>A hyper realistic Portrait of uploaded person ( preserve face 100%) wearing high-end fashion LV OUTFIT, the background is orange, the clothing is minimal, hyper realistic scene, the guy is just slightly visible due to dark shadows, and he is wearing modern fashion frames.</prompt>

For a classic, powerful businessman look, specifying the shadow and light distribution is paramount. A simple black background combined with a dramatic spotlight creates immediate impact.

<prompt>A dramatic spotlight in a dark room highlights the same face as the uploaded image. The man wears a patterned white shirt with a black suit and sunglasses, exuding a confident, intense expression. His hands are in his pockets, and the lighting casts deep shadows that define the contours of his face and body. The background is black. Create a realistic image.</prompt>

Finally, if you want a bold, color-driven aesthetic, specify the dominant colors and the camera type ("DSLR CAMERA style") to maximize realism and impact.

![A stylish, hyper-realistic DSLR-style portrait of a man sitting cross-legged in a modern red chair, wearing a bold red geometric jacket and sunglasses.](https://pub-141831e61e69445289222976a15b6fb3.r2.dev/insta_post/DPoP-5NjFe5/image_9.jpg)

## Ready to Elevate Your AI Game?

The common thread in all these successful generations is one critical phrase: **`same face`** (or a variation like `preserve face 100%`). This command, combined with meticulous detail on environment, lighting, and wardrobe, is what bridges the gap between a cool AI picture and a genuinely photorealistic self-portrait.

If you’re ready to stop settling for AI avatars that vaguely resemble you and start generating images that perfectly match your face and style, you need the full library of these detailed scripts.
